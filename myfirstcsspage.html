<h1><center>
Sungha Jung
</center></h1>


<p>Sungha Jung is a South Korean musician who specializes in acoustic fingerstyle guitar. 
He has a YouTube channel called jwcfree which has his song covers and compositions. Jung 
creates acoustic covers and arrangements, typically by ear and/or by watching videos, and 
has original music, which he plays and uploads online. He started playing since he was 9, 
now he's 20. Jungha was nicknamed the "Guitar Prodigy"
 and the "August Rush" in Korea, though he prefers to be known as a 'guitarist' rather than 
 a 'guitar prodigy'.

<p>Sungha Jung once came to my school and performed in the stage at the auditorium. I think it was in 2011.
<br> BUT, I didn't get to watch his performance. I don't really know why, because Im pretty sure that I was at school 
<br>at the time. Maybe I was running around on the playground or something(no wonder why it was so quite...)
