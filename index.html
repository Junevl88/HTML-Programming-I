<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>About me?</h2>
<h3>yes, About me.</h3>

<p>Hello my name is june and I am a freshman. This is my second year at harmony school and i really enjoyed it so far. Sadly, I dont have any pets at the moment.
My favorite movie is the Fast and Furious 1-7. Mainly because my parents work in an automotive business and whenever a new part comes out, we would 
watch it together as a family thing. Its also a very good movie I would recommend it to anyone.I also like watching gamers play horror/adventure video games on youtube.
I dont know why... maybe it seems easier to just watch someone play the game, because then you know what happens.
But,if i were to actually play a game,then i would choose to play until dawn. </p>
