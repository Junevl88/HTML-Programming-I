 <br><br><br><br>The series begins with Sarah Manning, a con artist by trade, witnessing the <br>suicide of a woman, Beth Childs,
 who appears to be her doppelganger. Sarah assumes Beth's identity and occupation (as a police detective) after Beth's <br>death.
 During the first season, Sarah discovers that she is a clone, that she has<br> many 'sister' clones spread throughout North America 
 and Europe, and that <br>someone is plotting to kill them and her.
 <br><br>Alongside her foster brother, Felix and two of her clones Alison and Cosima, <br>Sarah discovers the origin of the clones:
 a scientific movement called Neolution. <br> The movement believes that human beings can use scientific knowledge to direct their 
 evolution as a species. The movement has an institutional base in the large, influential, and wealthy biotech corporation, 
 the Dyad Institute, which is seemingly headed by Dr. Aldous Leekie. The Dyad Institute conducts basic research, lobbies 
 political institutions, and promotes its eugenics program, aided by the clone <br>Rachel Duncan. It also seeks to profit from the 
 technology the clones embody and has thus placed "monitors" into the clones' personal lives, allegedly to study them scientifically,
 but actually to keep them under surveillance.

<br><br>Sarah eventually discovers that she's also wanted by the police and by a secret religious group, the Proletheans. 
A faction of the Proletheans carries out the clone assassinations, because they believe clones are abominations, and they use 
Sarah's biological twin sister, Helena, to kill the other clones. Sarah and Helena share a surrogate birth mother and are twins 
both genetically and with respect to their early maternal environment.

Eventually, the Dyad Institute and the Proletheans learn that Sarah has a <br>daughter, Kira, the only known offspring of a clone;
all other clones are sterile <br>by design. The plot lines of the series revolve around Sarah and Kira's efforts to avoid capture by
the clearly sinister Neolutionists and Proletheans, as well as around the <br>efforts made by each clone to give sense to her life and
origin.
