<p>As Season 1 of BBC America's Orphan Black came to a close, I found myself thinking <br> what a perfectly serialized show this is.
 Most genre television shows these days have<br> some aspect of standalone-ness to them that fills in the dead air when the overarching 
 <br>story sputters, but Orphan Black was blessed with a 10 episode season, as opposed to <br>22 or even 13, that required no filler. 
 <p>With tight writing and multiple, thrilling overlapping stories, the season was a refreshingly dense viewing experience, one that was 
 so addictive and moved so fast that at times it reminded me of (high praise incoming) Homeland's full-steam-ahead storytelling. 
 But <br>Orphan Black was able to do something that not even the buzzy Showtime show could do: maintain that pace for an entire season.
 Orphan Black is lean, every second counts, and Season 1 was so well plotted and paced that it just kept on getting better and better.
